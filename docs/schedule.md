## Reading Assignments

All readings are available online free of charge. Some of them may require you to be on campus wi-fi or VPN or to be logged into your [NYU Google Drive](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-collaboration/document-collaboration-and-sharing/nyu-drive.html) account.

### Research Papers

In this course, we will be reading and discussing many research papers on the topic of language understanding. Readings to be discussed each week are shown in the schedule below. You may read the readings at your own pace, though you are expected to be familiar with their contents when they come up. Your understanding of the readings will be assessed via multiple-choice reading quizzes released periodically on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).
