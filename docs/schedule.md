These textbooks are primarily for reference; we will not be "following" them in any sense. Additional readings will
include research papers and blog posts. All readings are available online free of charge.
Some of them may require you to be on campus wi-fi or VPN or to be logged into your
[NYU Drive](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-collaboration/document-collaboration-and-sharing/nyu-drive.html)
account.

You do not have to do all the readings, but we will talk about most of them during class.
