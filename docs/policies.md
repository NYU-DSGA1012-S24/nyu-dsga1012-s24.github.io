# Course Policies

## Collaboration

Collaboration is strongly encouraged, both in this course and in the profession of NLP. Please make sure you adhere to
the following guidelines.

#### Homework Assignments

You may discuss the homework assignments with anyone at any time, but you must ultimately complete and write up the
assigned work for yourself.

#### Reading Quizzes

You are strongly encouraged to discuss the readings with your peers before the reading quizzes open, but you may not
discuss the readings or quiz questions with anyone while the quizzes are open.

#### Project

Projects should be completed in groups of three or four, which should be formed by the time the full proposal is
submitted.

## Academic Integrity

Work you submit should be your own. Please consult the
[GSAS Statement on Academic Integrity](https://gsas.nyu.edu/about-gsas/policies-and-procedures/gsas-statement-on-academic-integrity.html)
for more information. Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include failure of the course, suspension from
the University, or even expulsion.

Please follow these guidelines in order to avoid plagiarism.

#### Citations

All text and figures from an outside source, as well as descriptions or other depictions of baseline models and
datasets, must be cited [according to ACL guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).

#### Reusing code

All code submitted for homework assignments must be your own. You may reuse code submitted by others for the final
project, but all such reused code must be cited in your paper.

Violations of this policy will result in a zero grade for the submitted work and a referral to the University for
further investigation.

## Respectful, Inclusive, and Productive Participation

The field of NLP is a diverse, international community that benefits from incorporating a wide variety of different
perspectives. All members of the class, both students and members of course staff, are expected to foster an 
inclusive and productive environment by treating one another with civility and respect. Prejudice and discrimination in 
any form on the basis of race, sex, age, religion, national origin, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, 
disability status, socio-economic status, or other forms of identity are strictly prohibited. All students are entitled 
to the proper usage of names and pronouns that they designate.


## Religious Observance

As a nonsectarian, inclusive institution, NYU policy permits members of any religious group to absent themselves from
classes without penalty when required for compliance with their religious obligations. The policy and principles to be
followed by students and faculty may be found in the
[University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/university-calendar-policy-on-religious-holidays.html)
.

## Disability Disclosure Statement

Academic accommodations are available to any student with a chronic, psychological, visual, mobility, learning
disability, or who is deaf or hard of hearing. To obtain an accommodation,
