# Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics

**DS-GA 1012/LING-GA 1012, Spring 2024**<br />
**New York University**

This is an advanced master's level course in natural language processing, with focus on the representation of meaning at
various linguistic levels. Students will learn basic techniques in deep learning, transfer learning, and in-context
adaptation while being introduced to natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, syntactic and
semantic parsing, and question answering. The course will culminate in an original research project completed by the
student in collaboration with two to three classmates.

## Prerequisites

The recommended prerequisite for this course is _Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning_ (DS-GA 1011).
You will still be able to register for the course if you have not taken DS-GA 1011, but please be aware that this is an
advanced course. Students are expected to have seen most of the following concepts before.

{: .note }
> #### Calculus and Linear Algebra
> Partial derivatives, gradients, vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, vector spaces
>
> #### Probability and Statistics
> Probability distributions, conditional probabilities, Bayes's theorem, linear regression
>
> #### Machine Learning and Data Science
> Features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization, train/dev/test, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
>
> #### Python Programming
> Basic syntax, iterables/comprehension, Jupyter notebooks, package managers (e.g., `pip`), modules, object-oriented programming, data types
>
> #### Natural Language Processing
> Tokenization, vector semantics, language modeling

Since this is a graduate-level course with students from a diverse array of backgrounds (data science, computer science,
linguistics, and undergrads), many students will be unfamiliar with one or more of the above topics. This is okay, as
long as you feel comfortable looking up anything that you don't understand or asking for help when necessary.
