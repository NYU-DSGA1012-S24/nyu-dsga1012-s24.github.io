# Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics

**DS-GA 1012/LING-GA 1012, Spring 2024**<br />
**New York University**

Since at least the proposal of the Turing test, building computational systems that can communicate with humans using natural language has been a central goal for Al research. Understanding real, naturally occurring human language is the key to reaching this goal. This course surveys recent successes in language understanding and prepares students to do original research in this area, culminating with a substantial final project. The course will focus on text, but within that will touch on the full range of applicable techniques for language understanding, including formal logics, statistical methods, distributional methods, and deep learning, and will bring in ideas from formal linguistics where they can be readily used in practice. We'll discuss tasks like sentiment analysis, word similarity, and question answering, as well as higher level issues like how to effectively represent language meaning.

## Prerequisites

The recommended prerequisite for this course is _Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning_ (DS-GA 1011).
You will still be able to register for the course if you have not taken DS-GA 1011, but please be aware that this is an
advanced course. Students are expected to have seen most of the following concepts before.

{: .note }
> #### Calculus and Linear Algebra
> Partial derivatives, gradients, vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, vector spaces
>
> #### Probability and Statistics
> Probability distributions, conditional probabilities, Bayes's theorem, linear regression
>
> #### Machine Learning and Data Science
> Features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization, train/dev/test, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
>
> #### Python Programming
> Basic syntax, iterables/comprehension, Jupyter notebooks, package managers (e.g., `pip`), modules, object-oriented programming, data types
>
> #### Natural Language Processing
> Tokenization, vector semantics, language modeling

Since this is a graduate-level course with students from a diverse array of backgrounds (data science, computer science,
linguistics, and undergrads), many students will be unfamiliar with one or more of the above topics. This is okay, as
long as you feel comfortable looking up anything that you don't understand or asking for help when necessary.
