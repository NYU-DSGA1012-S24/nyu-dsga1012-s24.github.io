# Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics

**DS-GA 1012, Spring 2024**<br />
**New York University**

Since at least the proposal of the Turing test, building computational systems that can communicate with humans using natural language has been a central goal for Al research. Understanding real, naturally occurring human language is the key to reaching this goal. This course surveys recent successes in language understanding and prepares students to do original research in this area, culminating with a substantial final project.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have had some experience with most of the following concepts.

{: .note }
> #### Calculus and Linear Algebra
> Partial derivatives, gradients, vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, vector spaces
>
> #### Probability and Statistics
> Probability distributions, conditional probabilities, Bayes's theorem, linear regression
>
> #### Machine Learning and Data Science
> Features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization, train/dev/test, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), deep learning
>
> #### Python Programming
> Basic syntax, iterables/comprehension, Jupyter notebooks, package managers (e.g., `pip`), modules, object-oriented programming, data types
>
> #### Natural Language Processing
> Tokenization, vector semantics, language modeling

Since this is a graduate-level course with students from a diverse array of backgrounds (data science, computer science, linguistics, and undergrads), many students will be unfamiliar with one or more of the above topics. This is okay, as long as you feel comfortable looking up anything that you don't understand or asking for help when necessary.
