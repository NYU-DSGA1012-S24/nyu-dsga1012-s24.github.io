### Artificial vs. Human Intelligence

Humans acquire, generate, and process language in a very particular way. We explore ways in which humans and language models are remarkably similar in their language processing capabilities, yet also incredibly different. We review recent attempts to train language models in a way that mimics the developmental process of human language acquisition.
