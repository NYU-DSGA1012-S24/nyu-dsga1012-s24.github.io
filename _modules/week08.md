### What Is Language?

We learn about what language is and how to think about it objectively and scientifically. We critically examine popular assumptions about language, which are often driven by politics and prejudice rather than linguistics. We consider ways in which the techniques covered in this course do not apply equally to all languages.

Lecture
: Descriptive vs. prescriptive grammar, languages vs. dialects, linguistic nationalism and prejudice, generative grammar, typology and low-resource NLP
