### Doing Research in NLP

As you begin exploring project ideas, we will learn the basic scientific methodology of NLP. We discuss how to formulate a research question and design an experiment to answer it. We also learn about the peer review and publishing process for conferences, workshops, and journals affiliated with the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).
